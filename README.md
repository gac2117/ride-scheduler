# Ride Scheduler

This is my first full-stack application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). I also implemented Redux for state management, along with reactstrap for design. I got the idea for this project through many of my married friends who found it hard to manage rides for their active children. This application will allow a user (a rider) to request a ride, and then allow another user (a driver) to see the rides needed and offer to give a ride.

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
